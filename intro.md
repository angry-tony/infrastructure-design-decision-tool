# IBM Cloud Design Decision Tool - Introduction

## Using the IBM Cloud Design Decision Tool

The Design Decision Tool contains the potential advantages and disadvantages of the available components used for designing and building your infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) on IBM Cloud.  Use this information during your solution design to help select the best options to meet your workload requirements.  More information is provided in the [Solutions Design training class](http://www.softlayer.com/training-courses) which takes you through hands-on workshops to assist you with making architecture choices for your IaaS.

### How to use the Design Decision Tool 

The Design Decision Tool supports the infrastructure process (Figure 1) by stepping you through each component of your infrastructure to help you determine which options to use based on your requirements.  You are encouraged to use the design process and decision tool when designing your IaaS.

A high-level example workload has been provided to assist you with learning how to use the Design Decision Tool. After reviewing the example you can then apply the concepts to your workload.
